The Event Log API was designed to provide an alternative to the native eth_getLogs. Below are the list of supported filter parameters:

· fromBlock, toBlock, address
· topic0, topic1, topic2, topic3 (32 Bytes per topic)
· topic0_1_opr (and|or between topic0 & topic1), topic1_2_opr (and|or between topic1 & topic2), topic2_3_opr (and|or between topic2 & topic3),
    topic0_2_opr (and|or between topic0 & topic2), topic0_3_opr (and|or between topic0 & topic3), topic1_3_opr (and|or between topic1 & topic3)

- FromBlock & ToBlock accepts the blocknumber (integer, NOT hex) or 'latest' (earliest & pending is NOT supported yet)
- Topic Operator (opr) choices are either 'and' or 'or' and are restricted to the above choices only
- FromBlock & ToBlock parameters are required
- An address and/or topic(X) parameters are required, when multiple topic(X) parameters are used the topicX_X_opr (and|or operator) is also required
- For performance & security considerations, only the first 1000 results are return. So please narrow down the filter parameters

## Here are some examples of how this filter maybe used:
